          <h3>  Happy Twenty-Sixth Birthday, mi amor. I'm so happy that I've had the chance to know you 
            intimately and that we've shared an emotional bond for so long. Beyond me, I know 
            that the world should be grateful for having such an intelligent, funny, and 
            strong woman alongside it. You truly are a gift to this world and I'm extremely
            grateful for having the chance to love you.</h3>
          <h3>I know that things aren't looking the best for us; but despite this, I will
            always have the memories we've made in our journey together to gladly look back
            on. (like all the times we ate Ruffles Queso together and watched Ninety Day Fiance, 
            the two different times that we saw Niagara Falls, that time we stayed up late 
            drinking wine and watching Freaks and Geeks in Florida, or even that time when we
            watched Hunterxhunter together on our way to New York City in that bus.)</h3>
          <h3>I don't know where life is taking us, amorcito. But, thank you for loving me 
            for most of my adult life.</h3>
